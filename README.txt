Hello!
This is my submission for Roadmap.sh project available at https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game
I am roughly 2 weeks old into learning programming with no prior knowledge of it and picked up python for the easy syntax. I built this project using whatever knowledge I gathered reading the first 3 chapters of the book "Automating boring stuff with Python". It took me well over 1 hour to complete the code, However I marked the starting of project on project page only after I finished building it :P.

I have tried to align my code with basic requirement of the project, i.e:

>It asks you to set a difficulty level, I added a while loop to handle unexpected inputs.
>It limits your chances based on difficulty level.
>It hints you to adjust your guess.
>It allows you to play multiple times.

If I guessed it correctly, The roadmap project asked me to put this readme as instruction for executing the code file but I think that is hardly necessary here.
